## Instructions

- implement a player-vs-player chess web app
- the game starts at the position shown (don't bother with queen or pawn logic, just the logic of remaining pieces)
- when it's their turn, a player must be able to drag any of their pieces to any legitimate target square
- assume both players are sharing a computer

When you're finished, send us the link to your git repo.

## Bonus points

- highlight legal moves when a player picks up a piece
- replace Kasparov (black) with an unbeatable AI, and you can skip one interview
