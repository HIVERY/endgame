## Instructions

- implement a player-vs-player chess web app
- the game starts at the position shown (don't bother with queen or pawn logic, just the logic of remaining pieces)
- when it's their turn, a player must be able to drag any of their pieces to any legitimate target square
- assume both players are sharing a computer

## Advice

We like to be able to run your code. If it takes less than 5 steps to install, we like it even more. If it includes unit tests and we're able to run the unit tests, we like it even more. Having said those things, we will do our best to assess it without prejudice, and provide balanced feedback even if we don't wish to proceed with your job application.

## Bonus points

- highlight legal moves when a player picks up a piece
- replace Kasparov (black) with an unbeatable AI, and you can skip one interview
